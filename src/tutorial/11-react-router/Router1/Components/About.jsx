		When Israel grew up, he decided to do what
he liked best. He was a singer. He changed
his name to Irving Berlin. He sang in small
cafés in New York. Then, he became very
popular. Irving not only sang, he also wrote
songs. His music was played all over the
world. His songs were so admired that he was invited to visit the President of the U.S. He also
created musical plays.

		<p>
		They were performed on Broadway, where New York’s most famous
theaters are located. Irving became wealthy, but he was never greedy. He composed “God
Bless America,” a very well known song. He donated the money he earned from it to the Girl
Scouts and Boy Scouts. Another song he wrote is “White Christmas.” You may have heard it
playing in December. These songs helped Americans during World War II. They gave people
hope for victory

		Irving deeply loved America. He also loved New York City. He lived and worked there his
whole life. It was a long life, too. He lived to be 101 years old! We can be proud of Irving.
His life shows how important it is to work hard and do what you do best.
